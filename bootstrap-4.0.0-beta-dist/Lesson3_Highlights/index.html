            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is an interesting way to keep track of every stage of a prject. Version Control is a type of system that tracks and records all the changes a file or folder goes through in order to go back and see where things happened at each step, or version. The purpose of a Version Control System (VCS) is to allow the user to go back to any point in time when creating the project and allow them to manuver their way to get what they want. This is interesting to me because for a lot of past schoolwork it is not possible to go back and change something you did 20 steps ago. This topic is relevant to the course because we are going to be working on projects that may require us to go back to a certain point and fix or change something.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">History of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was not the first creation of its kind. BitKeeper was the first Version Control System and was used in conjunction with the Linux kernal software project. Three years after the company's start, the two companies decided they could not be functional together and disabled their free-of-charge status. Due to this event, the Linux development community decided to create their own tool using ideas they received from working with BitKeeper. I find this interesting because a companies history is always important to how things work in the company. I think this important to the class because as we use the product in order to do our own schoolwork, we want to know why these people are letting us use their product for free.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unlike other Version Control Systems, Git separates its data by using screenshots of miniature data changes. Other systems would separate them due to the differences from each file as they change over time. Git also uses local databses as opposed to other systems using databases from other computers and such, making Git significantly faster than the rest. There is so much more to Git than you can imagine. I think this topic is interesting because it makes me wonder why anyone would use other Version Control Systems. I think this is important to the class because we use Cloud9 which is technically a cloud database, but is also a local database because it uses only local systems. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two main ways to get a Git repository: 1)To take an existing repository and import it to Git, or 2)Clone an existing Git repository from another server. I find this interesting because I think it is cool that you have two options in case one of them would not be viable. I think this is important for the class because the respositories will help us keep track of everything we have done.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git breaks up files into different groups. Files can be in two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked means that the file was in the last snapshot. These tracked files can be broken down even further and be either modified, unmodifed, or staged. Untracked files are everything else in the directory. When cloning a repository, all files will be tracked and unmodified since nothing has been changed with them. I find this interesting because Git tries to make it super quick and efficient and user friendly. I think this is important to the class becuase it allows the user to work at their own pace. </p>
